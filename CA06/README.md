Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project aims to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm in order to better understand the different types of customers in a given dataset.

Dataset
The 'Mall_Customers.csv' dataset is used for this project, which can be found at the following link: https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/raw/main/CA06/Mall_Customers.csv. The dataset contains the following attributes:

CustomerID: Unique ID for each customer
Gender: Male or Female
Age: Age of the customer
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature (higher scores indicate higher spending)
Installation
The following libraries are required for this project: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.

Results
This project performs the following tasks:

Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
Preparing the data for clustering.
Implementing k-means clustering.
Visualize and analyze the clusters.
Write a report summarizing the findings.
